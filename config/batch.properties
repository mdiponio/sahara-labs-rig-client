###############################################################################

# Whether to test the instruction file extension. If this is set to true,
# File_Extension property must be set. The default value is false to specify
# not to test a file extension.
# Test_File_Extension [true|false]
# Test_File_Extension true
Test_File_Extension true

# Instruction file extension. Should be configured as a string specified the
# characters of the file extension. The file extension test will check if the 
# instruction file name ends with the configured extension.
# File_Extension <String>
# File_Extension tar.gz
File_Extension .tar.gz

# Whether to test for instruction file maximum size. If this is set to true,
# the File_Size property must be set with the maximum permissible instruction
# file size. The default value is false to specify not to test for file 
# size.
# Test_Max_File_Size [true|false]
# Test_Max_File_Size true
Test_Max_File_Size true

# Maximum file size of the instruction file in kilobytes.
# Max_File_Size <int>
# Max_File_Size 1024
Max_File_Size 1024

# Whether to test the instruction file for magic number. From the oracle of 
# all knowledge (Wikipedia!), magic numbers are common in programs across many
# operating systems. Magic numbers implement strongly typed data and are a form
# of in-band signalling to the controlling program that reads the data type(s)
# at program run-time. Many files have such constants that identify the 
# contained data. Detecting such constants in files is a simple and effective 
# way of distinguishing between many file formats and can yield further run-time 
# information.
# If this is set top true, the File_Magic_Number property must be set with a
# hexadecimal representation of the file magic number. The default value is
# false to specify not to test for file magic number.
# Test_Magic_Number [true|false]
# Test_Magic_Number true
Test_Magic_Number true

# File magic number in hexadecimal format. The prefix '0x' is optional.
# File_Magic_Number <hex>
# File_Magic_Number 0xCAFEBABE
File_Magic_Number 0xCAFEBABE
