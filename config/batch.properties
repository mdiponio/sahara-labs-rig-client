## Instruction File Sanity Checks                                            ##
###############################################################################
#
# Instruction file sanity checks ensure the uploaded instruction is 
# applicable to what the batch process may run. The configured batch runner 
# contains three such file sanity tests which may be run:
#
#     * File extension - if the uploaded file extension matches the configured
#               file extension
#     * File magic number - if the uploaded file magic number (a value in up to
#               the first eight bytes) matches the configured magic number.
#     * File maximum size - if the uploaded file size is less than the 
#               configured maximum file size.

# Whether to test the instruction file extension. If this is set to true,
# File_Extension property must be set. The default value is false to specify
# not to test a file extension.
# Test_File_Extension [true|false]
# Test_File_Extension true
Test_File_Extension true

# Instruction file extension. Should be configured as a string specified the
# characters of the file extension. The file extension test will check if the 
# instruction file name ends with the configured extension.
# File_Extension <String>
# File_Extension tar.gz
File_Extension .tar.gz

# Whether to test for instruction file maximum size. If this is set to true,
# the File_Size property must be set with the maximum permissible instruction
# file size. The default value is false to specify not to test for file 
# size.
# Test_Max_File_Size [true|false]
# Test_Max_File_Size true
Test_Max_File_Size true

# Maximum file size of the instruction file in kilobytes.
# Max_File_Size <int>
# Max_File_Size 1024
Max_File_Size 1024

# Whether to test the instruction file for magic number. From the oracle of 
# all knowledge (Wikipedia!), magic numbers are common in programs across many
# operating systems. Magic numbers implement strongly typed data and are a form
# of in-band signalling to the controlling program that reads the data type(s)
# at program run-time. Many files have such constants that identify the 
# contained data. Detecting such constants in files is a simple and effective 
# way of distinguishing between many file formats and can yield further run-time 
# information.
# If this is set top true, the File_Magic_Number property must be set with a
# hexadecimal representation of the file magic number. The default value is
# false to specify not to test for file magic number.
# Test_Magic_Number [true|false]
# Test_Magic_Number true
Test_Magic_Number true

# File magic number in hexadecimal format. The prefix '0x' is optional.
# File_Magic_Number <hex>
# File_Magic_Number 0xCAFEBABE
File_Magic_Number 0xCAFEBABE

# Whether to synchronise the results directory (batch process working directory
# to the another directory. If true, the results directory is copied to a
# different directory. If true the Sync_Dir_Destination property and 
# the Sync_Dir_Name property must be set with the results destination path name
# and result directory name respectively. The default is false.
# Sync_Results_Dir [true|false]
# Sync_Results_Dir false
Sync_Results_Dir false

# The absolute path name to the directory to store the results file / 
# directory. Macro variables may be used as path elements. This 
# directory must exist for storing results to succeed.
# Sync_Dir_Destination <path name>
# Sync_Dir_Destination /var/rigclient/__YEAR__/
Sync_Dir_Destination /tmp

# The name of either the results directory or results file depending on the 
# Compress_Dir setting. If Compress_Dir is true, this is used as the file 
# name and a suitable file extension is appended to the name.
# Sync_Dir_Name <string>
# Sync_Dir_Name __ISO8601__  
Sync_Dir_Name __USER__

# Whether to compress the results directory into a zip archive. The default
# false to not compress the results directory.
# Compress_Dir [true|false]
# Compress_Dir false
Compress_Dir false

# The compression level of the results file. This may be one of the following
# compression levels:
#     * BEST - Best compression
#     * DEFAULT - Default compression
#     * FASTEST - Fastest compression
# The default compression level is 'DEFAULT'.
# Compression_Level [BEST|DEFAULT|FASTEST]
# Compression_Level DEFAULT
