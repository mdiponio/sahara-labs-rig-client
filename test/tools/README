Directory for Rig Client test tools.  The required tools are:

  - PMD       - PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/). Tested with version 4.2.5.
                PMD scans Java source code and looks for potential problems like:
                  * Possible bugs - empty try/catch/finally/switch statements
                  * Dead code - unused local variables, parameters and private methods
                  * Suboptimal code - wasteful String/StringBuffer usage
                  * Overcomplicated expressions - unnecessary if statements, 
                    for loops that could be while loops
                  * Duplicate code - copied/pasted code means copied/pasted bugs

  - EMMA      - EMMA (http://emma.sourceforge.net/). Tested with version version 2.0.4019.
                EMMA is a Java code coverage tool.
                Released under the Common Public License v1.0.

  - NSIS ANT  - NSIS (http://nsisant.sourceforge.net/). Tested with version 1.2.
                NSIS generates the Windows installation packages. The NSIS Ant task
                allows NSIS to be invoked during an ANT build.
		    NOTE: NSIS must also be installed to use the 'package' task that generates
                a Windows installer on Windows. NSIS can be downloaded
