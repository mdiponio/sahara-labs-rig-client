Description of what development is required for a Rig Client for a rig that can be executed in batch mode. 
Developer must implement a ConfiguredControlledRig class that registers the Actions required for the rig, as well as identifying the ConfiguredBatchRunner that is associated with the rig
If the actions required do not yet exist, the new action classes must be written that implement the specified action interfaces
The ConfiguredBatchRunner class must be created for this rig which specifies what is invoked, how the file is verified, how it executes etc

 Including examples of class and method implementations from Remote Labs
