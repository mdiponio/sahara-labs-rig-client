<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Brief description:</h3>
The status page displays information about the current status of the rig
client including the overall status, exerciser details and session details.
<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Overall status:</h3>
The overall status of the rig client can be one of four different states.
These are:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Not registered</span> - When the rig client 
	starts up it registers itself with the configured scheduling server.
	If this fails, the 'Not registered' state is shown and the rig client
	is 'dark' from the rest of the remote laboratory system so cannot have
	users assigned to it. In this state the rig client will periodically
	attempt to register itself with the scheduling server. 	If the rig should
	be registered, some remedial steps are:
	<ol>
		<li>Check the rig logs. This should show the cause of failing 
		registration.</li>
		<li>Check the scheduling server is running.</li>
		<li>Check the configured scheduling server computer hostname and port
		are	correct (these are the configuration property <span class='code'>
		Scheduling_Server_Address</span> and <span class='code'>
		Scheduling_Server_Port</span> for scheduling server hostname and port
		respectively).
		<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
			<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
			<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> Try using the configured scheduling
			server address with a web browser. If the address is correct the 
			scheduling server administrative interface login should be displayed.
			For example, if the configured hostname is 'eng047151.eng.uts.edu.au'
			and the port is 8080, enter 'http://eng047151.eng.uts.edu.au:8080'. The 
			following should be displayed:
			<div style='text-align:center'>
				<img src='/img/ss_login.png' alt='Login' />
			</div>
			If this is not displayed either the address is incorrect or there is a
			problem with the network.
		</div></li>
		<li>Check there aren't any firewalls blocking access to the scheduling 
		server. If the computer is Linux, check iptables or if the computer is
		Windows, check the Windows firewall.</li>
		<li>Check the rig client name is unqiue. If another rig client has 
		registered with the same name, the rig client will fail scheduling
		server registration.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Online</span> - In this state the rig client is 
	registered with the scheduling server, all exerciser tests have succeeded
	and the rig is ready to have users assigned to it.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Offline</span> - In this state the rig client is 
	registered with the rig client but is offline because of some problem. When
	the rig is offline the reason is also displayed and the logs should have 
	messages stating the problem. The causes of the rig being offline are:
	<ul>
		<li>One or more exericiser tests has failed. The 'Exerciser details' 
		panel will show the test that has failed and its reason. To put the 
		rig back offline, resolve the issue causing the tests to fail.</li>
		<li>The action failure threshold has been exceeded. When an action (such
		as the '<span class='code'>RemoteDesktopAccessAction</span>' fails, a 
		counter is incremented. When the counter exceeds the action fail 
		threshold, the rig is taken offline. The root cause of the action 
		failure should then be investigated. To put the rig client back online
		either use the 'Clear Maintenance' button on the 'Main' page.
		<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
			<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
			<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The action fail threshold can be
			configured using the '<span class='code'>Action_Failure_Threshold
			</span>' configuration property.
		</div></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>In use</span> - The rig is currently being used by
	a user.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Exerciser details:</h3>
The exerciser details panel lists all the currently running rig client tests
and their states. If a test is offline, the test failure reason is shown. 
<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
	<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
	<span class='bold'>HINT:</span>To 'fix' an exerciser test which has put the
	rig offline, resolve the underlying failure reason and wait till it runs 
	again.
</div>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Session details:</h3>
The session details panel lists the currently assigned users to the rig.
The types of users who may be in session are:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Master</span> - The master user is the person
	initially assigned to the rig by the scheduling server. They 'control'
	the session and when they leave, either by choice or when the
	session expires, the session is terminated and all other users are 
	removed.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Slave Active</span> - Slave user who is
	subsequently assigned to the rig session who <em>should</em> 
	be able to perform control much the same as the master user.
	</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Slave Passive</span> - Slave user who is 
	subsequently assigned to the rig session who <em>should not</em> 
	be able to perform control on the rig. Typically thsese users should
	be passive session observers.</li>
</ul>
