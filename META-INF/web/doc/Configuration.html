<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Brief Description:</h3>
The configuration page allows configuration properties of the rig client
to be modified. When the properties are changed, the rig client configuration
files are backed up, then the changed property values are saved. However, some
properties require the rig client to be restarted (a warning box notifies of
this) and will only come in effect the next time the rig client is started.

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Information Discovery:</h3>
The rig client has an external operation to query configured information 
about the rig. Client side, this allows rig interface customisation (for the
example providing rig camera stream URLs to video player). When an 
information request is made, the configuration value of the requested keys 
value is parsed with macro substitution to replace tokens with runtime variables.
The following are a list of macros supported with their runtime substituted value:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__HOSTNAME__</span> - Rig client computer
	hostname.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__IP__</span> - Rig client computer IP 
	address.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__USER__</span> - The name of the assigned
	master user.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__RIG_NAME__</span> - The name of the rig.</li>
	<li><span class='bold code'>__RIG_TYPE__</span> - The type of the rig.</li>
</ul>
