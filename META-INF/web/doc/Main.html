<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Pages:</h3>
The <em>Pages</em> list contains links to te pages of the rig client 
administrative interface. The links consist of (briefly - consult the
relavant pages for more in-depth descriptions):
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Status</span> - Shows the current status of the
	rig client including session detais and exerciser tests statuses.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Configuration</span> - Allows the configuration 
	properties of the rig client to be viewed and changed.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Logs</span> - Log viewer displaying the latest
	log messages of the rig client since startup.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Diagnostics</span> - Runtime information about
	the rig client including process details; important paths (class path,
	library path, ...); memory utilisation; threads and their stack traces;
	Java virtual machine details and host operating system details.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Documentation</span> - All the important 
	information required for effective development, customisation and use of
	the rig client.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Operations:</h3>
The <em>Operations</em> list contains operations which change the 
temporal state of the rig client. The operations are:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Restart</span> - Soft restarts the rig client.
	This is a soft restart because the Java virtual machine is not
	restarted. Any in progress sessions are terminated, the scheduling
	server registration is removed, the server is stopped and all 
	exerciser tests are stopped before all being restarted. The rig type
	class is instantiated anew causing any all action classes and exerciser
	tests to be freshly loaded.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> Any modifications to the rig client 
		class path, such as dropping a Jar file in './lib', requires the rig 
		client service to be restarted using an operating system specific 
		mechanism.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Shutdown</span> - Shuts down the rig client. The
	rig client service is stopped and to subsequently start the rig client
	the rig client service must be started in some operating system specific
	mechanism.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Garbage Collection</span> - Peforms a Java virtual
	machine garbage collection which frees unused memory. The Java virtual
	machine automically performs this operation and it is safe to manually
	request this as many times as neccessary.</li>
</ul>
