<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Pages:</h3>
The <em>Pages</em> list contains links to pages of the rig client 
administrative interface. The links consist of:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Status</span> - Shows the current status of the
	rig client including session details and exerciser tests statuses.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Configuration</span> - Allows the configuration 
	properties of the rig client to be viewed and changed.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Direct Control</span> - Allows the direct control cache
	(store controller instances) to be viewed and modified. Also allows 
	introspection of controller classes to view and invoke action methods.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Logs</span> - Log viewer displaying the latest
	log messages of the rig client since startup.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Diagnostics</span> - Runtime information about
	the rig client including process details; important paths (class path,
	library path, ...); memory utilization; threads and their stack traces;
	Java virtual machine details and host operating system details.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Documentation</span> - All the important 
	information required for effective development, customization and use of
	the rig client.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>About</span> - Information about the Rig Client.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Operations:</h3>
The <em>Operations</em> list contains operations which change the 
temporal state of the rig client. The operations are:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Clear Maintenance</span> - Clears any maintenance 
	states the rig may having putting it back online. A rig client maintenance
	state is one which requires manual intervention to put it back online. Two
	maintenance states a rig may be in are:
	<ul>
		<li>Action failure threshold has been exceeded. If any action has failure
		more than an allowed limit, the rig is taken offline so it is not
		subsequently assigned to a user when it may not be in a useable state.</li>
		<li>The rig is explicitly put it into maintenace.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Clean Files</span> - Cleans backup files that the 
	rig client has created. These backup files are:
	<ul>
		<li>Configuration backups - These files are created in the rig client 
		configuration directories and backup the configuration state before 
		a change is made.</li>
		<li>Log backups - When using the <span class='code'>RolledFile</span>
		logger, when the log files reachs the configured maximum log file size,
		the log file is rolled to a backup file (has a number apended to it).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Garbage Collection</span> - Performs a Java virtual
	machine garbage collection which frees unused memory. The Java virtual
	machine automatically performs this operation and it is safe to manually
	request this as many times as necessary.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Restart</span> - Soft restarts the rig client.
	This is a soft restart because the Java virtual machine is not
	restarted. Any in progress sessions are terminated, the scheduling
	server registration is removed, the server is stopped and all 
	exerciser tests are stopped before all being restarted. The rig type
	class is instantiated anew causing any all action classes and exerciser
	tests to be freshly loaded.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> Any modifications to the rig client 
		class path, such as dropping a Jar file in './lib', requires the rig 
		client service to be restarted using an operating system specific 
		mechanism.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Shutdown</span> - Shuts down the rig client. The
	rig client service is stopped and to subsequently start the rig client
	the rig client service must be started in some operating system specific
	mechanism.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> On Windows, to start the rig client open
		'Control&nbsp;Panel'&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;'Administrative&nbsp;'Tools'&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;'Services'
		and in the list of services, start the rig client.
	</div>
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> On Linux, to start the rig client 
		execute <span class='code'>'/etc/init.d/rigclient&nbsp;start'</span> with
		root privileges.
	</div></li>
</ul>
