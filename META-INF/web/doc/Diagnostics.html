<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Brief description:</h3>
The diagnostics displays information about the running rig client. This is to
help diagnose potential problems and investiage error conditions. The 
diagnostics displayed on this page is automatically updated every 10
seconds.

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Runtime information:</h3>
The information shown on this tab is about the execution of the rig client.
The information fields are:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Name</span> - The runtime name of the Java virtual
	machine. The extact name format is virtual machine specific but is usually
	composed of &lt;Process PID&gt;@&lt;Computer hostname&gt;.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Start time</span> - The time when the rig client
	was started.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Uptime</span> - How long the rig client has been
	running in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Working directory</span> - The current / working
	directory (CWD) of the rig client which is the base path of relative file paths.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> The working directory is extremely
		important as the configuration files are loaded relative to it. 
	</div>
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The rig client service sets the working
		directory to the installation directory of the rig client.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Class path</span> - The list of directories and Jar
	files where classes are loaded from. Any class path location starting with
	'.' is relative to the working directory of the rig client.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> Any Jar file added to the 
		<span class='code'>'./lib'</span> directory is automatically added
		to class path on rig client start by the rig client service.
	</div>
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The rig client service allows explicit
		Jar files to be configured.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Boot class path</span> - The list of directories and
	Jar	files where the Java classes are loaded.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Library path:</span> The list of directories where 
	native libraries (i.e. for use with JNI) are loaded from.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>System properties</span> - The system properties of the
	rig client. System properties are used to configure the rig client 
	configuration system (i.e. configuration files).
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The rig client service can be 
		configured to add system properties.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Environment variables</span> - The environment 
	variables given to the rig client by the invocation environment. These
	are <span class='bold'>not</span> used to control rig client behaviour
	but are by default inherited by any batch control processes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>System</h3>
The information shown on this tab displays memory being used by the rig client
and active threads.
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>In use memory</span> - Shows the amount of memory
	current in use by the rig client in megabytes.
		<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT: Performing a garbage collection will reduce
		this.</span>
	</div></li> 
	<li><span class='bold'>Free memory</span> - Free memory shows the amount
	of memory that is assigned to the rig client and not being used.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Total memory</span> - Total memory shows the memory
	assigned to the rig client by the operating system.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Max memory</span> - Max memory shows the amount of
	memory that can be assigned to the rig client by the operating system if it
	is needed.
		<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> If the rig client in use memory 
		approaches the max memory limit there is most likely an underlying
		memory leak issue and should be further investigated.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Current threads</span> - Shows the number of currently 
	active threads. Thread allocation in the rig client is:
	<ul>
		<li>Startup thread, 'main', which manages rig client startup, restart
		and shutdown.</li>
		<li>Exerciser threads with one thread per test. These are named after
		the tests they run.</li>
		<li>Scheduling server update thread which is named 'Status Updater' and 
		periodically updates the scheduling server of the rig client status..</li>
		<li>HTTP server thread. This accepts threads requests and dispatches them
		to a worker.</li>
		<li>HTTP worker threads which have 'qtp' in their name.
		<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
			<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
			<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> The number of these threads should
			not	exceed the configured concurrent request limit.
		</div></li>
		<li>Other miscellenous Java virtual machine threads such as 
		'Finalizer'.</li> 
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Daemon threads</span> - Daemon threads do not keep
	the Java virtual machine running (i.e. when all threads are daemon threads,
	the rig client terminates). Exceriser tests and HTTP worker threads are
	daemon threads.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Peak threads</span> - The highest number of
	concurrent threads that have been running.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Total started threads</span> - The total number of
	tests that have been started. If a test action involves running a system 
	process, this number can get quite large.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Thread stack traces</span> - These list of active 
	threads. The information shown about thread is:
	<ul>
		<li>Thread unique identifer.</li>
		<li>Thread name.</li>
		<li>Thread state.</li>
		<li>Thread cpu time, rather how long the thread has been in the 
		runnable state.</li>
		<li>Thread stack trace. This shows the currently executing method at the
		top of the stack and the list of method invocations that from thread start
		got to the current method.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Java</h3>
The information show on this tab displays Java virtual machine details.
<ul>

</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>OS</h3>
The information show on this tab display host operating system details.
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Operating system</span> - The name of the 
	operating system.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Version</span> - The operating system version.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Arch</span> - The operating system architecture.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE: On Linux 64bit architectures (displayed as
		'amd64') should use a rig client service executable compiled for 64bit
		Linux.</span> 
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Processors</span> - The number of processors 
	avaliable to the Java virtual machine.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>File separator</span> - The separator between 
	directories in file paths. This is dependant on the operating 
	system running.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The separtor '/' works on both
		UNIX and Windows and should on Windows instead of the displayed
		character '\'. The '\' character is used as the special character
		escape character, so if '\' is used, it should be escaped using
		'\' (i.e. C:\\foo\\bar\\baz).
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Path separator</span> - The character delimiting 
	file paths in the rig clients class path and library path. This is 
	dependant on the operating system running.</li>
