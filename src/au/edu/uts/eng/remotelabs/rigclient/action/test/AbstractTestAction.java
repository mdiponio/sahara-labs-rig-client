/**
 * Abstract test action class which uses a run flag to implement the 
 * <code>ITestAction.run</code> contract which specifies a persistent
 * thread never terminating for the life of the rig client. The following
 * flags may be modified to change its behavior:   
 * <ul>	
 *  <li><code>isPeriodic</code> - Specifies if the test interval is 
 *  periodic (<code>true</code>), so runs every <code>runInterval</code> 
 *  seconds or if it runs at a random time between 0 seconds and the 
 *  <code>runInterval</code> seconds (<code>false</code>). Generally 
 *  tests which result in <em>visible</em> effects (i.e. something moves) 
 *  should not be periodic to mimic real lab use (not everything lab
 *  runs at the same time). The default is for tests to be periodic. </li>
 *  <li><code>isSetIntervalHonoured</code> - Specifies if the test 
 *  interval is changed when the <code>setInterval</code> method is 
 *  invoked. The default is to honour the test interval.</li>
 *  <li><code>runInterval - The time between each test run in seconds. The 
 *  default is 60 seconds.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> The abstract methods declared in this class
 * do not provide any indication of the success of their invocation. The 
 * relative success or failure of them should be indicated by calls
 * to <code>getStatus</code> and <code>getReason</code>.
