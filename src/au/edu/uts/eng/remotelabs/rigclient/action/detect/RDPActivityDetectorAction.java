/**
 * This class checks for activity for a rig that uses Remote Desktop for access.  If a user has
 * a session active on the Remote Desktop machine, the rig is considered to be in use. If there is 
 * no active session, the rig is considered to be unused.
 * <p>
 * An active session is determined using the <code>qwinsta</Code> command.  Any session with a 
 * STATE = "Active" is considered valid for determining a rig is in use.
 * <p>
 * This command is only valid for Windows systems
